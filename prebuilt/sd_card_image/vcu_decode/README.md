# **Prebuilt sd_card image with VCU decode**

**1. Burning the image on micro SDcard**

Using an SD card flashing tool like dd, Win32DiskImager, or Balena Etcher, burn the image `sd_card.img` to an SD card and boot the board.

This version uses a non-volatile root file system stored on the SD card. Some post-installation setup is necessary.

* You should follow the steps of <https://github.com/alex0620ee05/Self-checkout-system/blob/main/set_up_files/README.md> to finish the post-installation setup
